# project-ruby
Project exercise from 'Web development 101' of The Odin Project

So this was a challenging assignment, which really pushed my basic knowledge of Ruby.

I found myself constantly referring to documentation of methods and googling to fill in the gaps.

My solutions are definitely not pretty or the most efficient but they work. Overall I've developed a deeper understanding of Ruby and Test Driven Development.

I plan to revisit this assignment later and improve my solutions once I feel more advanced in Ruby.
